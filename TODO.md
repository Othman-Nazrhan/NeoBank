# Refactoring Dashboard App TODO

## Layout and Typography Refinements
- [ ] Adjust margins/padding for cleaner sections in Dashboard.tsx
- [ ] Ensure consistent bold typography hierarchy (font weights, sizes)

## Gradients and Glassmorphism Enhancements
- [ ] Enhance gradients with subtle overlays on balance card
- [ ] Improve backdrop-blur effects on balance card, charts, and transactions sections

## Micro-interactions and Animations
- [ ] Add fade-in ripple effects on quick action buttons
- [ ] Add animated icons in quick actions (scale/bounce on press)
- [ ] Add hover-like effects on cards (subtle lift on touch for balance and 3D card)
- [ ] Implement spring-based transitions for data updates (balance, transactions)

## Personalization and Highlights
- [ ] Add adaptive transaction highlights based on user patterns (edit TransactionList.tsx if needed)

## Followup and Testing
- [ ] Test animations on device/simulator
- [ ] Verify personalization logic
- [ ] Ensure dark/light theme compatibility
